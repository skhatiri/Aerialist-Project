The goal of the AERIALIST project is to enable simulation-based testing and test automation for UAVs, particularly by addressing the reality gap in testing UAV software. To achieve this ambitious goal, the project first investigates systematic solutions for the runtime monitoring of UAV behavior, enabling early triggering of self-healing procedures in case of misbehaviors. Furthermore, it focuses on approaches reducing the simulation-based testing cost, by predicting test outcomes without running simulations, and by extracting less expensive lower-level tests from simulated tests. 

The project has been funded by the [Hasler Foundation](https://haslerstiftung.ch/).
