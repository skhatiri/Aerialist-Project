 [**Sebastiano Panichella**](https://spanichella.github.io) is a passionate Computer Science Researcher at the University of Bern (UniBe). He received the PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sannio (Department of Engineering) in 2014 defending the thesis entitled ''Supporting Newcomers in Open Source Software Development Projects''.

His main research goal is to conduct industrial research, involving both industrial and academic collaborations, to sustain the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, where future "smart cities" will be characterized by millions of smart systems and AI-enabled systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems such as drones, and other autonomous vehicles) connected over the internet, composed by AI-components, and/or controlled by complex embedded software implemented for the cloud.
